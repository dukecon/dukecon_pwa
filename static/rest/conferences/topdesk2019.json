After that we'll split up into subgroups and divide the structures. Each subgroup will spend about 15 minutes on each question for all assigned structures.\n\nWe complete the session by sharing the highlights and insights we got during the breakout sessions from the subgroups.\n\n",

      "abstractText": "Recently our software has often had performance problems, especially on SaaS. Sometimes SaaS environments are completely taken down and clients are unable to use TOPdesk. We at the Performance Guild want to take action to reduce these problems. And we need your help! We see that more and more development teams are making performance tests and creating performance metrics. We'd like to get together and see how we can share experience and tools among teams.\n\nThis session will start with a short introduction about our recent performance issues. We’ll continue with an interactive session where you can:\n\n- share experience you and your team have with performance (testing, monitoring, troubleshooting)\n\n- brainstorm about how we can better collaborate to deliver software that performs well, and about how the performance guild can help development teams",

These are broad topics, but we will discuss specific questions in order to keep the session focused.\n\nExtensive knowledge of the topics is not required. We'd rather have more programmers attending, such that the guidelines are widely supported, than having really in-depth nit-picky discussions between experts.\n\nThe format will be as follows: you will be seated in small groups (4-6 persons). We pose a statement and introduce it. You'll then spend a couple of minutes forming an opinion within your group. Then we gather the opinion of all groups. If there is consensus, we directly form it into a guideline. If more discussion is needed, then we'll appoint representatives of the different stances. These representatives are then expected to continue the discussion at another time and settle on a guideline.\n\nThe guidelines that stem from this session will be the law! ",

      "abstractText": "Presentation patterns provide a common language to talk about dos and don’ts during presentations. Using fun examples I’ll highlight some of the common patterns and anti-patterns I notice during IDMx sessions, conferences and other presentations. Have you ever created “Slideuments”? Do you like to go “Meta”? Do you long for a “Brain break”? All while “Defying Defaults”? Attending this session will show you how this jibberish will improve your public speaking skills.\n\nThis presentation is based on the book “Presentation patterns” by Ford, McCullough and Schutta. The Pattern and anti-pattern concept resonates so well with developers that I’d love to introduce it within TOPdesk to enable better feedback on presentations. And better presentations overall!",
